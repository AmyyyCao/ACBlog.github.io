<body><h3>Imposter syndrome and other things I've learned to care less about</h3>

<p1></p1>
<style type="text/css">
			ul {list-style-type: none;}
		</style>
<ul>
	<li>1. The 5 and 5 rule: When you find yourself panicking, take a 5 minute break and lie down somewhere. Close your eyes and ask what’s bothering you in this exact moment. It can be anyone and anything. Ask yourself, realistically, how long will this problem persist for? If it won’t matter in 5 years, it’s not worth beating yourself up. If it’s an assignment, it’ll go away after the deadline. You’ll look back and realize how insignificant it was eventually, just give yourself some time.</li>

	<li>2. Remind yourself that you’re doing enough. When everyone around you seems to be landing internships and studying for that exam a month in advance and you feel like you can’t keep up, you don’t have to. You don’t need to move at their pace, because there’s things happening in your life that’s not happening in theirs, and vice versa.</li>

	<li>3. You’re not responsible for the behaviour of other people. How someone else chooses to think, speak, and act has nothing to do with you. Don’t take things too personally, and again, stop adding excessive burden into your life.</li>

	<li>4. There’s always another chance. Sometimes, you don’t get the things you want in the moment but have faith that something better is coming soon. You just need to make it past this for now. Life has a way of putting things together and working itself out.</li>

	<li>5. If you’re an over-thinker, stay away from coffee. The anxiety and jittery feeling will take hours to wear off, and you won’t be having fun during that time. Unless you’re able to function well with caffeine, try a cup of tea with honey instead.</li>

	<li>6. Don’t make any promises. Have a mere vision of what you want to accomplish instead. Things change too quickly, save yourself from the disappointment of an unwanted outcome. If you get what you want, great, if not, take it as it is and move onto the next. I noticed that I’ve almost always done the things I promise not to do. The temptation just grows when you’re constantly suppressing yourself. Curiosity can snowball into an obsession.</li>

	<li>7. Don’t put an expiry date on yourself. You’re not a can of peas or a box of stale crackers. Biological clocks are BS, do what makes you content, not what gives others the perception of your contentment. Pick up the pace if you're capable, slow down if you can't keep up.</li> 

	<li>8. Learn to walk away from people who make you feel less as an individual. You don't owe anyone any explanations. Do not try to please other people at the expense of your own happiness, it is not sustainable. The length of a relationship does not determine its value.</li>

	<li>9. Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Your instinct rarely lies so don't get gaslighted.  If you find their actions questionable, your values don’t align.</li>

	<li>10. Don't dwell on things that have already happened. I don't believe in the idea of regret. Learn to forgive yourself, there's no need to make your life any more difficult than it already is. Admit you were wrong, and don't do it again. But in case you're like me and you do it again, learn a little more this time.</li>

	<li>11. In the least cringe way possible, you don't need to be like the other girls.</li>

	<li>12. Don't have any expectations for other people, but don't confuse expectations with standards. Whatever your ideal is, it'll likely be shattered by reality. Perception is often delusional.</li>

	<li>13. Toxicity can be addicting, especially when it feels familiar. It's normal to be drawn to people who make you feel a certain way, even if it's bad. Give yourself a break, just because someone is incapable of providing something, doesn't mean you're not deserving of it.</li>

	<li>14. Let people learn on their own. You're not responsible for "fixing" them, spend your time, energy, and effort on yourself. Everyone with a past carry some form of emotional burden. It's not up to you to sort it out.</li>

	<li>15. Don't fear impermanence, it gives life meaning.</li>

	<li>16. You're the biggest critic of yourself. No one cares enough to constantly be judging you. Wear whatever you want, post whatever you want. It's easy to be self-conscious, but trust me when I say that no one is looking at you twice.</li>

	<li>17. Stop apologizing for everything. Passiveness will only shrink you down unnecessarily. Don't say sorry for taking up space.</li>

	<li>18. Some people are exactly who they warn you to avoid.</li>
