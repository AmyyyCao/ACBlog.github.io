<h3>Imposter syndrome and other things I've learned to care less about</h3>

<p1>As I am typing this paragraph, there are currently six weeks left of this school year. Time flies, regardless of how much fun you're having, but I am eternally grateful for all the help I've received along the way. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to add that I'm not looking for pity, or even compassion of any sort. One thing I've learned to value the most throughout all of this is transparency. The willingness to admit that not everything is going well. First term was a mess. So here is a small list of strategies I use to calm myself down, because just like everyone else, I also frequently forget that life is finite.</p1>
<style type="text/css">
			ul {list-style-type: none;}
		</style>
<ul>
	<li>1. The 5 and 5 rule: When you find yourself panicking, take a 5 minute break and lie down somewhere. Close your eyes and ask yourself what’s bothering you in this exact moment. It can be anyone and anything. Ask yourself, realistically, how long will this problem follow you for? If it won’t matter in 5 years, it’s not worth beating yourself up. If it’s an assignment, it’ll go away after the deadline. You’ll look back and realize how insignificant it was eventually, just give yourself some time.</li>
	<li>2. Remind yourself that you’re doing enough. When everyone around you seems to be landing internships and studying for that exam a month in advance and you feel like you can’t keep up, you don’t have to. You don’t need to move at their pace, because there’s things happening in your life that’s not happening in theirs, and vice versa.</li>
	<li>3. Lo-fi. It’ll mend your soul. And even better, no lyrics mean no distractions.</li>
	<li>4. There’s always another chance. Sometimes, you don’t get the things you want in the moment but have faith that something better is coming soon. You just need to make it past this for now. Life has a way of putting things together and working itself out.</li>
