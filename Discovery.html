<h3>Imposter syndrome and other things I've learned to care less about</h3>

<p1>As I am typing this paragraph, there are currently six weeks left of this school year. Time flies, regardless of how much fun you're having, but I am eternally grateful for all the help I've received along the way. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to add that I'm not looking for pity, or even compassion of any sort. One thing I've learned to value the most throughout all of this is transparency. The willingness to admit that not everything is going well. First term was a mess. </p1>
