                    <p class="description">You’re not responsible for the behaviour of other people. How someone else chooses to think, speak, and act has nothing to do with you. Don’t take things too personally, and again, stop adding excessive burden into your life.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="description">There’s always another chance. Sometimes, you don’t get the things you want in the moment but have faith that something better is coming soon. You just need to make it past this for now. Life has a way of putting things together and
                        working itself out.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="description">Every situation in life is temporary, both the good and the bad. Things are tough, I understand. How can you possibly plan for tomorrow but you’re not even sure if you can get past today? Perhaps your plans have utterly and completely
                        gone off track, you’re scared, and that’s completely okay. It’s through overcoming adversity and challenges that will make you more grateful when you arrive at where you want to be.</p>

                    <p class="description">Don't dwell on things that have already happened. You will always screw up, putting excessive guilt and shame on yourself won't change anything. Learn to forgive yourself, there's no need to make your life any more difficult than it
                        already is. Admit you were wrong, and don't do it again. But in case you're like me and you do it again, learn a little more this time.</p>

                    <p class="description">Toxicity can be addicting, especially when it feels familiar. It's normal to be drawn to people who make you feel a certain way, even if it's bad. Give yourself a break, just because someone is incapable of providing something, doesn't
                        mean you're not deserving of it.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="description">Let people learn on their own. You're not responsible for "fixing" them, spend your time, energy, and effort on yourself. Everyone with a past carry some form of emotional burden. It's not up to you to sort it out.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="description">Don't fear impermanence, it gives life meaning.</p>

                    <p class="description">You have control over everything, but you also don't have control over anything. That sentence probably hurt your brain to read, because it hurt mine to type. You have control over how you choose to react, but you have no control over
                        the obstacles you’ll encounter along the way. A change in plans can surprise you in the best way.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">12</h3>
                    <p class="description">Just because someone is at a point in their life that you’re envious of, it doesn’t mean that you need to follow the same road. Your life is up to you. You’re doing things at your own pace, and you’re doing whatever you can right now.
                        It’s a possibility, and as long as you’ve got a chance, anything can happen.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">

                    <p class="description">Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Your instinct rarely lies so don't get gaslighted.&nbsp;If you find their actions questionable, your values don’t align.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">
                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">14</h3>
                    <p class="description">Learn to walk away from people who make you feel less as an individual. You don't owe anyone any explanations. Do not try to please other people at the expense of your own happiness, it is not sustainable. The length of a relationship
                        does not determine its value.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">
                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">15</h3>

                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">16</h3>
                    <p class="description">Make the decision. Someone once pointed out that my indecisiveness was simply my method of staying passive. It took me a long time to realize what that meant. If you’ve made up your mind about something, stop fluctuating between possibilities.
                        And here is where the paradox of choice comes in. Resist the temptation to question your decision. What’s done is done.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">
                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">17</h3>
                    <p class="description">Be unapologetic. Stop saying sorry for taking up space, chasing after your goals, or just being you.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">
                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">18</h3>
                    <p class="description">What you're doing is none of anyone else's business. What other people are doing is also none of your business.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 item">
                    <h3 class="text-center name" style="font-size: 50px;">19</h3>
                    <p class="description">See people for who they really are, not who you want them to be. Love authenticity over fantasy.&nbsp;</p>
