<h3>Imposter syndrome and other things I've learned to care less about</h3>

<p1>As I am typing this paragraph, there are currently six weeks left of this school year. Time flies, regardless of how much fun you're having, but I am eternally grateful for all the help I've received along the way. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to add that I'm not looking for pity, or even compassion of any sort. One thing I've learned to value the most throughout all of this is transparency. The willingness to admit that not everything is going well. First term was a mess. So here is a short list of 18 things I learned at 18, because just like everyone else, I also frequently forget that life is finite.</p1>

<ul>
	<li>1. The 5 and 5 rule: When you find yourself panicking, take a 5 minute break and lie down somewhere. Close your eyes and ask what’s bothering you in this exact moment. It can be anyone and anything. Ask yourself, realistically, how long will this problem persist for? If it won’t matter in 5 years, it’s not worth beating yourself up. If it’s an assignment, it’ll go away after the deadline. You’ll look back and realize how insignificant it was eventually, just give yourself some time.</li>

	<li>2. Remind yourself that you’re doing enough. When everyone around you seems to be landing internships and studying for that exam a month in advance and you feel like you can’t keep up, you don’t have to. You don’t need to move at their pace, because there’s things happening in your life that’s not happening in theirs, and vice versa.</li>

	<li>3. Lo-fi is magical. It’ll mend your soul. And even better, no lyrics mean no distractions.</li>

	<li>4. There’s always another chance. Sometimes, you don’t get the things you want in the moment but have faith that something better is coming soon. You just need to make it past this for now. Life has a way of putting things together and working itself out.</li>

	<li>5. If you’re an over-thinker, stay away from coffee. The anxiety and jittery feeling will take hours to wear off, and you won’t be having fun during that time. Unless you’re able to function well with caffeine, try a cup of tea with honey instead.</li>

	<li>6. Don’t make any promises. Have a mere vision of what you want to accomplish instead. Things change too quickly, save yourself from the disappointment of an unwanted outcome. If you get what you want, great, if not, take it as it is and move onto the next. I noticed that I’ve almost always done the things I promise not to do. The temptation just grows when you’re constantly suppressing yourself. Curiosity can snowball into an obsession.</li>

	<li>7. Don’t put an expiry date on yourself. You’re not a can of peas or a box of stale crackers. Biological clocks are BS, do what makes you content, not what gives others the perception of your contentment. Pick up the pace if you're capable, slow down if you can't keep up.</li> 

	<li>8. Learn to walk away from people who make you feel less as an individual. You don't owe anyone any explanations. Do not try to please other people at the expense of your own happiness, it is not sustainable. The length of a relationship does not determine its value.</li>

	<li>9. Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Your instinct rarely lies so don't get gaslighted.  If you find their actions questionable, your values don’t align.</li>

	<li>10. Don't dwell on things that have already happened. I don't believe in the idea of regret. Learn to forgive yourself, there's no need to make your life any more difficult than it already is. Admit you were wrong, and don't do it again. But in case you're like me and you do it again, learn a little more this time.</li>

	<li>11. In the least cringe way possible, you don't need to be like the other girls.</li>

	<li>12. Don't have any expectations for other people, but don't confuse expectations with standards. Whatever your ideal is, it'll likely be shattered by reality. Perception is often delusional.</li>

	<li>13. Do something out of the ordinary. Go skydiving, hiking, bungee jumping, and exploring. Life is short and the world is wide.</li>

	<li>14. Let people learn on their own. You're not responsible for "fixing" them, spend your time, energy, and effort on yourself. Everyone with a past carry some form of emotional burden. Its not up to you to sort it out.</li>

	<li>15. Don't fear impermanence, it gives life meaning.</li>

	<li>16. You're the biggest critic of yourself. No one cares enough to constantly be judging you. Wear whatever you want, post whatever you want. It's easy to be self-conscious, but trust me when I say that no one is looking at you twice.</li>

	<li>17. Stop apologizing for everything. Passiveness will only shrink you down unnecessarily. Don't say sorry for taking up space.</li>

	<li>18. It's alright to not feel your best at all times.</li>
